## Theory

Classical ciphers are encryption techniques that have been used for centuries to secure communication. They use simple substitution or transposition methods to encode messages. These ciphers were widely used before the advent of modern cryptography, but they are still important today as they provide the basis for many modern encryption algorithms.

Substitution ciphers are methods in which letters or groups of letters in a message are replaced with other letters or symbols to produce the encrypted message. Examples of substitution ciphers include the Caesar cipher and the monoalphabetic cipher.

Transposition ciphers, on the other hand, rearrange the letters of a message without changing their values. The most famous example of a transposition cipher is the Rail Fence cipher.

Classical ciphers have several weaknesses, including the fact that they can be easily broken by cryptanalysis. They can also be vulnerable to brute-force attacks, where every possible combination of letters is tried until the correct one is found. However, they are still useful as educational tools and as a way to introduce the basic concepts of cryptography.

## Objectives:

1. Get familiar with the basics of cryptography and classical ciphers.
2. Implement 4 types of the classical ciphers:

- Caesar cipher with one key used for substitution (as explained above),
- Caesar cipher with one key used for substitution, and a permutation of the alphabet,
- Vigenere cipher,
- Playfair cipher.

3. Structure the project in methods/classes/packages as neeeded.
